## Description

J.A.T.E is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to provide users with a versatile and a rich text editor experience. My motivation behind building this project was to offer a modern and user-friendly text editor that could be accessed from any device with a web browser as well as be installable making it convenient for users to be offline and still create, edit, and save text documents. I have gained valuable experience by implementing offline functionality, and creating user-friendly interfaces and just how important it is to make my applications cross-platform compatible.

**Key Features:**

- Syntax highlighting for JavaScript, mainly.
- Installation as a standalone app on supported devices.
- User-friendly interface for efficient text editing.
- Accessibility: J.A.T.E can be used on any device with a web browser, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
- Offline Productivity: The offline support ensures that users can continue working on their text documents even when they are not connected to the internet.
- Cross-Platform: J.A.T.E is not limited to a specific operating system, allowing users to switch between devices seamlessly.

## Installation

[To use J.A.T.E, simply visit the website using a web browser](https://stark-depths-32465-9c6c904f031b.herokuapp.com). No installation is required since it is a Progressive Web Application (PWA). However, if you prefer to install it as a standalone app, follow these steps:

1. Open J.A.T.E in Google Chrome or another supported browser.
2. Click the Install button (the upper-left corner).
3. Click Yes to the Prompt.
